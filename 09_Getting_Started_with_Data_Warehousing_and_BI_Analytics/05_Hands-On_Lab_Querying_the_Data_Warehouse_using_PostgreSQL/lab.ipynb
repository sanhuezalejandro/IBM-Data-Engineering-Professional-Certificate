    "https://www.coursera.org/learn/getting-started-with-data-warehousing-and-bi-analytics/ungradedLti/gIGkx/hands-on-lab-querying-the-data-warehouse-using-postgresql-cubes-rollups-grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Purpose of the Lab:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this lab is to provide hands-on experience in advanced SQL query techniques using PostgreSQL in a Cloud IDE environment. The lab focuses on teaching how to create grouping sets, rollups, and cubes for data aggregation and summarization, as well as how to implement and utilize Materialized Query Tables (MQT) for efficient data querying. These skills are essential for managing and analyzing large datasets, particularly in data warehousing and business intelligence contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Benefits of Learning the Lab:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will gain valuable insights into the practical application of complex SQL queries and data manipulation techniques. The knowledge of grouping sets, rollups, and cubes will enable learners to effectively summarize and analyze data, which is crucial in making informed business decisions. Understanding and implementing MQTs provides an efficient way to handle large-scale data by reducing the computational load during frequent query executions. These skills are highly beneficial for careers in data analysis, database administration, and business intelligence, enhancing your ability to manage and analyze data in real-world scenarios.\n",

    "- Rollup\n",
    "- Cube\n",
