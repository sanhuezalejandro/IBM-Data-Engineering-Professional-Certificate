    "# **Hands-on Lab: Working with Facts and Dimension Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Purpose of the lab:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab is designed to guide you through the process of designing a data warehouse for a cloud service provider. It focuses on using billing data provided in a CSV file to create a star schema, including the design of fact and dimension tables. This schema will support complex queries related to billing, such as average billing per customer, billing by country, industry, and category, as well as trends over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Benefits of Learning the Lab:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will acquire practical skills in organizing and analyzing large datasets using data warehousing techniques. These skills are essential for making informed business decisions, optimizing data retrieval, and enhancing the understanding of data relationships. This knowledge is particularly beneficial in real-world scenarios, such as analyzing cloud billing data, where it can lead to more efficient data management and insightful analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Study the schema of the given csv file\n",
    "- Design the fact tables\n",
    "- Design the dimension tables\n",
    "- Create a star schema using the fact and dimension tables"
