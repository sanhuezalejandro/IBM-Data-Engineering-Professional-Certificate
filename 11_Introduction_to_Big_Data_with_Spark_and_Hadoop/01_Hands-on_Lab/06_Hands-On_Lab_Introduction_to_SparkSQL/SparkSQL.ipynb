become the de-facto standard in processing big data.

As a result, many data pipelines define UDFs in Java and Scala and then invoke them from Python.\n","\n","Pandas UDFs built on top of Apache Arrow bring you the _best of both worlds_—the ability to define low-overhead, high-performance UDFs entirely in Python.
