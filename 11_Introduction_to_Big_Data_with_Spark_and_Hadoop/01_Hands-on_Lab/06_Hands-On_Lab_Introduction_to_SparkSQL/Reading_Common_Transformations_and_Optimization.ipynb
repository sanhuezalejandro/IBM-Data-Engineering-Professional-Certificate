    "# Reading: Common Transformations and Optimization Techniques in Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're working with PySpark DataFrames for data processing, it's important to know about the two types of transformations: narrow and wide. Narrow transformations in Spark work within partitions without shuffling data between them. They're applied locally to each partition, avoiding data exchange. On the other hand, wide transformations in Spark involve redistributing and shuffling data between partitions, often leading to more resource-intensive and complex operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this concept better, let's take a look at the following illustration.\n",

    "\n",
    "Within narrow transformations, data is transferred without executing data shuffling operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Narrow transformations can be compared to performing straightforward operations on distinct data sets. Consider having various types of data in separate containers. You can perform actions on each data container or shift data between containers independently without requiring interaction or transfer. Examples of narrow transformations include modifying individual pieces of data, selecting specific items, or combining two data containers.\n",
