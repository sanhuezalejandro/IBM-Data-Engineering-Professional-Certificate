    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a Kubernetes Pod - a set of containers running inside Kubernetes - here, containing Apache Spark which we use to submit jobs against Kubernetes\n",
    "- Submit Apache Spark jobs to Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the lab on how to submit Apache Spark applications to a Kubernetes cluster. This exercise is straightforward thanks to the new native Kubernetes scheduler that has been added to Spark recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes is a container orchestrator which allows to schedule millions of “docker” containers on huge compute clusters containing thousands of compute nodes. Originally invented and open-sourced by Google, Kubernetes became the de-facto standard for cloud-native application development and deployment inside and outside IBM. With RedHat OpenShift, IBM is the leader in hybrid cloud Kubernetes and within the top three companies contributing to Kubernetes’ open source code base.\n",

    "- *–conf spark.executor.instances=1* tells the Apache Spark native Kubernetes scheduler how many Pods it has to create to parallelize the application. Note that on this single node development Kubernetes cluster increasing this number doesn’t make any sense (besides adding overhead for parallelization)\n",
    "- *–conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=romeokienzler/spark-py:3.1.2* tells the Apache Spark native Kubernetes scheduler which container image it should use for creating the driver and executor Pods. This image can be custom build using the provided Dockerfiles in *kubernetes/dockerfiles/spark/* and *bin/docker-image-tool.sh* in the Apache Spark distribution\n",

Since we’re using a *jar* provided by the Apache Spark distribution this is not a problem, otherwise the *spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path* option has to be set and an appropriate storage subsystem has to be configured, as described in the [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-kubernetes.html#running-spark-on-kubernetes)\n",
